Constraints overview
--------------------

.. glossary::

    Constraints 
        add information to your sketches that control their behavior when they are modified

Constraint Settings
-------------------

AUTO-CONSTRAINING
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. glossary::

    Auto-constraining
        include Horizontal/Vertical, Perpendicular, Tangent (when an arc is created at an endpoint),
        and Coincident

CONSTRAINT & LOCKED DIMENSION VISIBILITY
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Adding and removing constraints
-------------------------------

ADDING CONSTRAINTS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. glossary::

    Add constraints 
        * The constraints menu
        * keyboard shortcuts by shift and letter
        * Drag and drop to connected point, coincident, midpoint
        * lock

    Schetch constraints
        * Parallel - sets parallel relationship between sketch line elements
        * Perpendicular - sets a right angle (90Â°) between elements
        * Tangent -  create a tangent relationship between sketch elements
        * Coincident - make sketch endpoints coincident with other elements
        * Midpoint - connect an endpoint with the center of a line
        * Concentric - create a concentric relationship between sketch arc elements
        * Horizontal/Vertical - create a horizontal or vertical relationship between linear sketch elements
        * Equal - creates an equal length for selected lines and an equal radius for selected arcs and circles
        * Symmetry - lie on opposite sides of an axis of symmetry
        * Disconnect - break the connection between connected points
        * Lock/Unlock - fixes a selected sketch element in its current position
        * Make construction -convert your sketch elements into construction geometry
